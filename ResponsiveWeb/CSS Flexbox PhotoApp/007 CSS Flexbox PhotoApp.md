# CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery

Flexbox is a one-dimensional CSS layout approach that focuses on the flow of content. It offers the ability to control the way items are spaced and aligned within a container.

To set an element to use Flexbox, you give it a display property set to flex. Create a #gallery selector and give it that property.

Flexbox can be thought of as having two axes, the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is determined by the flex-direction property. If flex-direction is set to row or row-reverse, the main axis is horizontal. If flex-direction is set to column or column-reverse, the main axis is vertical.

Give your #gallery selector a flex-direction property set to row.
